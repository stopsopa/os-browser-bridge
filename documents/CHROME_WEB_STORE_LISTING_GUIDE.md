## Store Listing Form Fields

### Basic Information

#### **Extension Name**
```
OS Browser Bridge
```

#### **Summary** (132 characters max)
```
Real-time event bridge between Node.js servers and browser tabs for developers building integrated applications.
```

#### **Description** (16,000 characters max)
```
OS Browser Bridge creates a seamless real-time event based communication channel between Node.js server (any server with websockets really) applications and browser tabs, enabling developers to build integrated server-browser experiences that were previously impossible with standard web APIs.

## Key Features

üîó **Bidirectional Event Bridge**
- Send events from server to any browser tab in real-time
- Forward events from browser tabs back to server applications
- Cross-tab communication through centralized server hub

‚ö° **Real-Time Communication**
- WebSocket-based persistent connections
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Visual connection status indicators

üõ†Ô∏è **Developer-Friendly**
- Works with any Node.js server application
- Simple event-based API
- Transparent operation with detailed logging
- Open source and fully inspectable

üåê **Universal Compatibility**
- Functions across all websites and domains
- Supports localhost development and production environments
- Compatible with microservices and multi-domain architectures

## Use Cases

**Development & Testing**
- Broadcast build completion notifications to all development tabs
- Synchronize state across localhost, staging, and production environments
- Real-time debugging and monitoring integration

**Enterprise Applications**
- System notifications delivered to any web application
- Cross-application event coordination
- Integration of OS-level events (battery, network, sleep/wake) into web apps

**Advanced Web Applications**
- Real-time collaboration features
- Server-driven UI updates
- Cross-tab synchronization

## How It Works

1. **Server Setup**: Run the included Node.js server or integrate with your existing application
2. **Extension Connection**: Extension automatically connects to your WebSocket server (default: localhost:8080)
3. **Event Bridge**: Send events from server using simple API calls, receive them in browser tabs as DOM events
4. **Bidirectional Flow**: Browser tabs can also send events back to server and other tabs

## Technical Details

- **Default Configuration**: Connects to localhost:8080 (completely local)
- **Privacy First**: No data collection, all communication under your control
- **WebSocket Protocol**: Efficient real-time communication
- **Event System**: Uses DOM CustomEvents for seamless integration
- **Connection Management**: Automatic reconnection and status monitoring

## Perfect For

- Full-stack developers building integrated applications
- DevOps engineers needing real-time monitoring integration
- System administrators building custom dashboards
- Teams requiring cross-tab communication
- Anyone needing server-to-browser event integration

## Getting Started

1. Install the extension
2. Configure your server URL in the extension popup (defaults to localhost:8080)
3. Use the included Node.js server or integrate WebSocket events into your existing application
4. Start receiving real-time events in your web applications

This extension bridges the gap between server-side processes and browser environments, enabling a new class of integrated applications that respond to server events in real-time.

Open source and privacy-focused - all code is available for inspection and all communication stays under your control.

### Privacy & Permissions

#### **Single Purpose Description**
```
Creates a real-time bidirectional communication bridge between Node.js server applications and browser tabs, enabling server events to be delivered to web pages and browser events to be sent to server applications.
```

#### **Permission Justifications**

**Host Permissions (`<all_urls>`)**
```
Required to inject content scripts across all websites where users need server event integration. The extension must function on any domain where developers want to receive server events - from localhost development to production environments. Predefined domains would severely limit the extension's core functionality as a universal event bridge.
```

**activeTab**
```
Used for popup functionality to display connection status and allow configuration of the WebSocket server URL.
```

**scripting**
```
Essential for injecting content scripts that establish the event bridge communication channel between server and web pages.
```

**tabs**
```
Required to broadcast server events to multiple browser tabs simultaneously and enable cross-tab communication through the server hub.
```

**alarms**
```
Manages automatic WebSocket reconnection attempts to ensure reliable server communication without user intervention.
```

**storage**
```
Stores user configuration (server URL, connection preferences) locally between browser sessions.
```

#### **Data Usage**

**What data does your extension collect?**
```
No user data is collected. The extension only transmits:
- User-defined event data explicitly configured by web applications
- Basic connection metadata (browser ID, tab ID) for event routing
- Connection status information
```

**How is user data used?**
```
Not applicable - no user data is collected.
```

**Data handling compliance**
```
All data transmission is user-controlled and limited to explicitly configured events. By default, all communication occurs locally (localhost). No personal information, browsing history, or analytics are collected.

### Review Preparation

**Common Review Points to Address:**
1. **Broad Permissions**: Your HOST_PERMISSIONS_JUSTIFICATION.md addresses this thoroughly
2. **Privacy Policy**: Your PRIVACY_POLICY.md clearly states no data collection
3. **Functionality Demo**: Ensure screenshots clearly show the extension's purpose
4. **Code Quality**: Your code is well-structured and documented

### Launch Timeline

**Typical Review Process:**
1. Initial submission: 1-3 business days for automated checks
2. Manual review: 7-14 business days (can be longer for broad permissions)
3. Possible follow-up questions about host permissions
4. Approval and publication

### Post-Launch

**Maintain compliance by:**
- Keeping documentation updated
- Responding promptly to any Chrome Web Store team questions
- Monitoring user feedback and addressing issues quickly
- Maintaining the same functionality scope (don't expand without review)
